## RAGent

RAGent is a powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that allows you to upload a PDF document and ask questions about them using Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash AI model. Built with modern tools for scalability, observability, and ease of use.

## Features

- **PDF Upload & Processing**: Upload PDFs and automatically chunk them for efficient retrieval
- **Semantic Search**: Uses vector embeddings to find the most relevant information
- **AI-Powered Answers**: Leverages Google Gemini 2.0 Flash for accurate, context-aware responses
- **Observability**: Built-in workflow tracking with Inngest
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful Streamlit interface with gradient designs
- **Docker Support**: Easy deployment with Docker containers
- **Vector Database**: Fast similarity search with Qdrant
